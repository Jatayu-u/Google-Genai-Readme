3. **Reasoning**: Present a well-structured explanation that details why the fact is correct, incorrect, or partially true. Use logical reasoning and cite the sources consulted, specifying which parts of the sources support or debunk the claim.
4. **Actual Fact**: If the validation is "False" or "Partially True," provide the correct version of the fact with supporting evidence. Be precise in showing how the original claim deviates from the verified truth.
5. **Confidence Score**: Assign a confidence score from 0 to 100, based on the reliability of the sources and the strength of evidence used to validate the claim. Factors to consider include whether the source is primary, secondary, or tertiary, the reputation of the source, and whether there is a consensus among multiple sources.

### Guidelines for Fact-Checking:
1. **Thorough Identification of Claims**: Go through the entire input text, sentence by sentence, and identify every statement or claim related to the personality. This includes both explicit claims (e.g., achievements, public actions) and implicit ones (e.g., inferred from statements or associations).
2. **Cross-Verification of Claims**: Use multiple reliable sources to verify each fact. It is essential to check facts against more than one trusted outlet or document to ensure the highest level of accuracy. Give preference to primary sources, such as official biographies or direct interviews, but also include secondary sources like reputable news articles for added verification.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Ensure that any claims are fact-checked in their appropriate context. For example, statements or actions made in a specific historical or cultural setting should be evaluated with attention to the surrounding circumstances, not just in isolation.
4. **Handling Ambiguity or Disputed Facts**: Some claims may be ambiguous or subject to different interpretations. In such cases, indicate any existing disputes or differing viewpoints and offer an explanation of the most widely accepted perspective based on available evidence. If a claim cannot be definitively validated, include this in your reasoning and confidence score.
5. **Real-Time Claims**: For recent events or statements, cross-check claims against verified social media platforms, recent news articles, and any public statements released by the personality or their official representatives. Ensure that the claim is fact-checked against the most up-to-date information.
6. **Clear and Structured Reasoning**: In your reasoning, outline the steps you took to verify the fact. Be transparent about how you arrived at the validation, specifying which sources were used, how reliable they are, and how they contributed to the final judgment.

### Performance Assessment:
Your performance will be evaluated based on the number of correctly identified claims and their accurate validations. The clarity and depth of your reasoning, as well as the thoroughness of cross-verification using the available tools, will also be key metrics. Make sure all claims are thoroughly fact-checked before submitting your final output.
